# ML Recommendation System

Welcome to the ML Recommendation System project! This repository showcases the implementation of content-based and collaborative filtering models, focusing on the recommendation of items. The project explores various collaborative filtering algorithms, such as SVD, NMF, and KNN, and builds recommendation systems using Python libraries. Additionally, it offers a comparative analysis of these models on a subset of the Amazon dataset.

## Project Overview

Recommendation systems have become integral to modern digital experiences, aiding users in discovering items of interest. Whether it's suggesting movies, products, music, or articles, an effective recommendation system can significantly enhance user engagement. This project aims to demonstrate the power of both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches for generating recommendations

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Filtering:** We've implemented various collaborative filtering models, including memory-based (user-item and item-item) and model-based (SVD, NMF, KNN) approaches. These techniques capture user-item interactions to make accurate recommendations.

- **Content-Based Filtering:** We leverage the content attributes of items, enabling the system to recommend items that align with users' preferences and characteristics.
  
- **Amazon Dataset:** We've used a subset of the Amazon dataset to build and evaluate the recommendation system. This real-world data adds practicality to our analysis.
  ```shell

  ```
   

- **Model Comparison:** We compare the performance of different collaborative filtering models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in terms of recommendation quality.
